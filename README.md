Copy these variables into a .env file:

UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=

```

Edit the site.ts file in the config folder:

```bash
export type SiteConfig = typeof siteConfig

export const siteConfig = {
  name: "ACME Management",
  description:
    "Beautifully designed components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.",
  businessName: "ACME (Pty) Ltd",
  domain: "https://www.acme.com",
  domainShort: "ACME.com",

      href: "/",
    },
  ],
  links: {

Push the pre-generated schema to your Neon database and create your first user with a password of "Changeme2024!" (after logging in you will be directed to update your password).

You can also add a user via Drizzle Studio. Make sure you have Drizzle Kit installed.
